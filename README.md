# weather-app


With this web application, the user can see the weather forecast for his/her nearby area or any city they input.


I have created this app using Node's Express.js as the back-end.
The server sends an API request to OpenWeatherMap.org. 

For nearby weather, it takes the users geo-co√òrdinates from the front-end and sends it to the server through a POST request. 

I have used the following tools to build this app:
 - Express.js
 - CSS
 - Handlebars
